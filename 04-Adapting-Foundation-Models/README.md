## Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach for keeping Generative AI models informed with the most recent data, particularly when dealing with domain-specific questions. It cleverly combines the comprehensive understanding capacity of a large language model (LLM) with the most up-to-date information pulled from a database of relevant text snippets. The beauty of this system is in its ability to ensure that responses remain accurate and reflective of the latest developments.

### **How RAG Works**
When a query is made, the system first retrieves relevant documents or snippets from a knowledge base.

These retrieved pieces of information are then used as context for the generative model to produce more informed and accurate responses.

### **Benefits of RAG**
-   **Enhanced Accuracy**: By incorporating real-time data from external sources, RAG can provide up-to-date and contextually relevant information.
-   **Reduced Hallucination**: Generative models sometimes produce incorrect or fabricated information (known as "hallucination"). RAG helps mitigate this by grounding responses in actual retrieved data.

### **Applications**
RAG can be applied in various domains, including customer support, knowledge management, and conversational AI, where accurate and context-aware responses are crucial.

## Prompt Design Techniques

-   **Task Descriptions**: Abstract descriptions that explain the task the model needs to perform.

### **Mechanism**
The model processes the provided context and uses it to generate appropriate outputs. For instance, if given examples of how to format a response, the model will follow that pattern in its output.
    
### **Challenges**
While in-context learning is powerful, it can be challenging for models to consistently follow complex instructions or constraints, especially when the task requires nuanced understanding.
    
### **Applications**
This learning approach is useful in various applications, such as language translation, summarization, and question-answering, where the model can leverage the context to improve its performance.


## Chain-of-Thought Prompting
_Chain-of-Thought Prompting_  is a vital technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps that lead to a solution. By providing models with a line of reasoning, they can more effectively tackle problems that require more advanced problem-solving processes, enabling them to deduce information, such as the number of cookies in a box, after considering all variables.

### **Example Illustration**
To illustrate this with an example, let's consider a math word problem where the model struggles to solve it without guidance. 

_**Problem:**
A baker bakes 60 cookies. She sells 15 of them to a customer and then packs the rest equally into 5 boxes. How many cookies are in each box? 
**Answer:** 
9 cookies_ 
_**Problem:** 
A baker bakes 30 cookies. Five of them are burnt. She sells 15 of them to a customer and then packs the rest equally into 5 boxes. How many cookies are in each box?_ 
**Answer:** 
3 cookies

By using chain-of-thought prompting, the model is given a structured approach to break down the problem into manageable steps, leading to the correct solution. Here it is:
_**Problem:**
A baker bakes 60 cookies. She sells 15 of them to a customer and then packs the rest equally into 5 boxes. How many cookies are in each box? 
**Answer:**_
_1. Start with the total number of cookies, which is 60.
2. Subtracted the number of cookies sold to the customer, 15, from the total.
3. Calculate the remaining cookies: 60 - 15 = 45 cookies. 
4. Divide the remaining cookies equally into 5 boxes. 
5. To find out how many cookies are in each box: 45 / 5 = 9 cookies._ 

_**Problem:** 
A baker bakes 30 cookies. Five of them are burnt. She sells 15 of them to a customer and then packs the rest equally into 5 boxes. How many cookies are in each box?
**Answer:**_
 _1. Start with the total number of cookies, which is 30.
 2. Subtract the number of burnt cookies, 5, from the total. 
 3. Calculate the remaining cookies: 30 - 5 = 25 cookies.
 4. Subtract the number of cookies sold to the customer, 15, from the remaining cookies.
 5. Calculate the remaining cookies: 25 - 15 = 10 cookies. 
 6. Divide the remaining cookies equally into 5 boxes. 
 7. To find out how many cookies are in each box: 10 / 5 = 2 cookies._


### **Steps in the Process**:
-   The model is prompted to outline its reasoning process step-by-step.
-   Each step builds on the previous one, guiding the model through the logic required to arrive at the final answer.

### **Benefits**
This technique improves the model's ability to handle complicated queries by encouraging it to "show its work," which can lead to more accurate and coherent responses.

### **Applications**
Chain-of-thought prompting can be applied in various domains, including mathematics, logic puzzles, and any task requiring multi-step reasoning.


## Using Probing to Train a Classifier
Using probing to train a classifier is a powerful approach to tailor generative AI foundation models, like BERT, for specific applications. By adding a modestly-sized neural network, known as a classification head, to a foundation model, one can specialize in particular tasks such as sentiment analysis. This technique involves freezing the original model's parameters and only adjusting the classification head through training with labelled data. Ultimately, this process simplifies adapting sophisticated AI systems to our needs, providing a practical tool for developing efficient and targeted machine learning solutions.

### **Linear Probing**
This is a common probing technique where a simple linear classifier is added to the output of a pre-trained model. The idea is to freeze the parameters of the foundation model and only train the newly added classifier on a labelled dataset.
    
### **Training Process**
    
-   The model is trained on a specific task, such as sentiment analysis or classification, using a labelled dataset.
-   The classification head learns to map the encoded representations from the foundation model to the desired output labels.

    
### **Benefits**
Probing allows researchers to leverage the knowledge encoded in large pre-trained models while adapting them to specific tasks efficiently, leading to improved performance without the need for extensive retraining.


## Fine-Tuning
